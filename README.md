# Quantum_synth
Development of an interface between Qiskit and Max8 to generate superposition of notes encoded on the basis states of a quantum computer.

The system is composed of 3 layers:
- Max musical graphical interface
- Middleware exchanging data between Max and the circuit
- Circuit module generation

A video description of the project is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2E9PL2YTkk).
